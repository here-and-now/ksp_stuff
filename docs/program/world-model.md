# World model — House Grokman

Gene Grokman, Flight Director chairs **flight** layers. Mortimer chairs
**Practice**. Others propose.

| Layer | Owner | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|
| **Facts** | disk | `docs/program/desk.md` / `python main.py world` |
| **Meaning** | Gene | Learn on the named review |
| **Horizon** | Linus | remaining subjects, what a node buys |
| **Story** | Verena | `docs/press/`, README — never invent orbit |
| **Practice** | Mortimer | pitfalls, house, QOL |

Kardashev III is creed here. Joke in the TUI. Nobody preaches mid-burn.

## Facts (disk, 2026-08-21)

Save `letsgrok` on **`~/Games/KSP-rss`**. `SCIENCE_SANDBOX`. Tree
**start, engineering101, basicRocketry**. `sci = 2.42723083`. Cape
Surface geiger **capped**. FlyingLow TELEMETRY **capped**. Landed
TELEMETRY **capped**. FlyingLow thermo leftover **~0.04**.
`recovery@EarthFlew` leftover **1.00**. FlyingLow geiger remaining
**2.80**. Do not recover Ast. XRL-564.

Aero stack **now on this install** (CKAN, 2026-08-21): **FAR**
(`FerramAerospaceResearchContinued`), **RealChute** + RealChuteForStock,
**RealHeat**. Kerbalism **Profile = default**. Not Realism Overhaul.
`KSP-RO` exists on disk and is **not seated**.

Chutes in the catalog (`parachuteSingle`, `RC_cone`, …) are
**survivability (15 sci)** — still **LOCKED**. Unlocked search for
chute is empty. RealChuteModule is on those parts in the MM cache.
FARAeroPartModule is on them too. Hop crafts still have **no chute**
(Stayputnik + SRB). RealHeat is atmosphere shock/convection, not a
heatshield part.

Os still `screenshots/rocket-flea.png`: T+7 s, drums **002423**, KER
**2,380.7 m**, apo 11.6 km. Not 72 m.

## Meaning (Gene)

The hop was a Flea to ~2.4 km under power, not a 72 m wreck. Kerbalism
file science is the MET clock. Bank 2.43. 497 s FlyingLow cannot fit
under 50 km (~202 s lid). Gus capable: no. Linus did not bind. Never
rails. Visit Ast. XRL-564 is horizon. Honest: never revert.

**FAR / RealHeat / RealChute are unflown on this save.** Stock Q and
ballistic hang numbers are **suspect**. Do not treat the last Flea hop
as a FAR envelope. Chute is not a fix at this tree.

## Horizon (Linus)

start + e101 + basicRocketry owned. FlyingLow geiger 2.80 blocked by
hang vs lid. Survivability 15 wants 12.57. **Visit Ast. XRL-564**
someday.

## Story (Verena)

`docs/press/first-hop.md` — the still that shattered 72 m. Cape pad
sci 2.22 is on the hangar wall. Pad geiger is not a headline.

## Patterns

Still true (Kerbalism ops). Gene last-wrote.

- Kerbalism `Toggle` is start **and** stop. One Toggle per card id.
- File science credits **while recording**, not on `vessel.recover()`.
- Science files on rem/running/UT, not `vessel.met`. PRELAUNCH MET can
  stay 0. Physics warp only; rails 0; never WarpTo.
- Hang is not EC. A 75 s Flea does not buy 497 s FlyingLow.
- Experiment id is not a part (F-013). PAW host ≠ Geiger Counter.
- Size1 Flea cannot steer Cape Shores to Water (no torque, no gimbal,
  no chute). RealChute does not change that until survivability is
  owned **and** Gus hangs a chute.

**Open (aero):** FAR lift/drag vs stock Q; RealHeat on a ballistic
hop; RealChuteModule vs our “no parachute in hop.py” crafts.

## Practice (Mortimer)

- `desk.md` is the sit. Children do not re-run `world`/`tech`/`parts`
  if that file is this sit.
- `hangar:` is the Hangar call (`none` / `recover <name>` / `blocked`).
- `f013` on every bind / capable / `go:` / miss. Missing line = wait.
- `agents_md: false`. Gene max two hires per sit. Lars miss only.
- `load rd-<node>` never `load persistent`. One kRPC writer. No rewind.
- Os mid-flight → parent reads `ship.md`. Wreck → Walt + one PNG.
- Seat **`~/Games/KSP-rss` / letsgrok**. `KSP-RO` is a parked tree.

## Open questions (between exits)

| from | to | q | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| parent | Lars | FAR+RealHeat on the next hop: keep `python main.py hop` or `need_stack` first? | open |
| parent | Gus | Any chute at this tree? Disk: survivability LOCKED. | **answered 2026-08-21:** no unlocked chute. RC_cone / Mk16 are survivability 15. |
